# KHompare

Compare KHelse data to check for any abnormal changes.

# Installation

To install the package run

``` r
if(!requirenamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("helseprofil/orgdata")
```

# Usage

To check a cube file for *ALKOHOL*

``` r
library("KHompare")
dt <- check_cube("ALKOHOL")
```

Comparison will be made on the measurements created by `LagKUBE()`
function in **KHfunction** such as:

-   MEIS
-   RATE
-   TELLER
-   SMR
-   etc ..

New columns of these measurement variables will be created when running
the function `check_cube()` and they are:

-   *xxx*\_NUM
-   *xxx*\_PCT

The *xxx* is the name of the measurement variables that are checked for
the difference in change numerically and percent. They are denoted by
*NUM* and *PCT* respectively.
