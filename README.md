    #> âœ– The 'origin' remote is configured, but we can't determine its default branch.
    #>   Possible reasons:
    #>   - The remote repo no longer exists, suggesting the local remote should
    #>     be deleted.
    #>   - We are offline or that specific Git server is down.
    #>   - You don't have the necessary permission or something is wrong with
    #>     your credentials.
